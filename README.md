## Why MCP Debug Tools?

Traditional AI coding assistants can **read** and **write** code, but they can't **debug** it. MCP Debug Tools removes this limitation by giving AI agents direct access to VS Code's debugger through simple CLI commands.

| Without MCP Debug Tools | With MCP Debug Tools |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| AI guesses at bugs from code reading | AI sets breakpoints and inspects live runtime state |
| "Try adding a console.log here" | AI steps through code line-by-line automatically |
| Manual copy-paste of error messages | AI reads call stacks and variable values as JSON |

### 💡 Direct CLI Control — Works Without MCP Connection

Beyond the standard MCP proxy, you can execute debugging actions via **one-off terminal commands** — no persistent connection required.

- **Terminal AI Friendly**: Shell-based AI agents interact with the debugger directly
- **Zero Connection Overhead**: No need to configure or maintain an MCP server connection
- **Easy Parsing**: Results in pure JSON (`stdout`), logs separated to `stderr` — AI parses instantly
- **Scriptable**: Integrate VS Code debugging into automated bash scripts seamlessly

```bash
# Discover all available tools
npx @uhd_kr/mcp-debug-tools list

# Execute tools directly
npx @uhd_kr/mcp-debug-tools call add-breakpoint '{"file": "src/app.ts", "line": 15}'
npx @uhd_kr/mcp-debug-tools call step-over
```

## 🚀 What's New in v1.0.0

### 🤖 AI Agent Skill Auto-Injection
The extension now **automatically injects skill documents** into your workspace when activated, so AI agents can discover and use debugging tools **without any manual configuration**.

| AI Platform | Auto-detected Path | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Gemini** (Google) | `.gemini/skills/dap-cli-debugging/SKILL.md` | ✅ Supported |
| **Claude Code** (Anthropic) | `.claude/skills/dap-cli-debugging/SKILL.md` | ✅ Supported |

### 🔌 Offline CLI Support
Run the CLI directly from the VS Code extension's install path — **no internet or npx required**.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
node ~/.vscode/extensions/uhd.mcp-debug-tools-*/out/cli.js call get-active-session

# Windows (PowerShell)
node "$env:USERPROFILE\.vscode\extensions\uhd.mcp-debug-tools-*\out\cli.js" call get-active-session
```

### 📖 Comprehensive Tool Documentation
All **29 debugging tools** are now fully documented in the auto-injected skill file, organized by category with parameters and usage examples.

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### 1. Finding and Fixing Bugs
Ask your AI assistant to help debug your code:
```
"There's an error in my calculateTotal function. Can you set breakpoints
at the start of the function and step through to find the issue?"
```
The AI will:
- Set breakpoints in the problematic function
- Start debug session
- Step through code line by line
- Inspect variables to identify the bug
- Suggest fixes based on the debugging data

### 2. Understanding Complex Code Flow
When exploring unfamiliar codebases:
```
"I need to understand how the authentication flow works. Can you trace
through the login process step by step?"
```
The AI will:
- Identify key authentication functions
- Set strategic breakpoints
- Run through the authentication flow
- Explain each step with actual runtime data
- Show how data transforms through the process

### 3. Validating Data Processing
For data transformation pipelines:
```
"Please verify that my data transformation pipeline correctly processes
the input array and produces the expected output format"
```
The AI will:
- Set breakpoints at transformation stages
- Inspect input data structure
- Monitor data changes at each step
- Validate output against requirements
- Identify any data integrity issues

### 4. Performance Bottleneck Detection
Finding performance issues:
```
"My application is running slowly. Can you help identify which functions
are taking the most time during execution?"
```
The AI will:
- Set breakpoints at function entry/exit points
- Monitor execution flow
- Identify functions called frequently
- Suggest optimization opportunities
- Highlight potential bottlenecks

### 5. Exception Handling Analysis
Debugging runtime errors:
```
"My app crashes with an unhandled exception. Can you catch it and show
me the exact state when it occurs?"
```
The AI will:
- Monitor for exceptions
- Capture exception details and stack trace
- Show variable states at crash point
- Analyze the root cause
- Suggest error handling improvements

### 6. Test-Driven Debugging
Debugging failing tests:
```
"My unit test is failing. Can you debug the test execution and show me
why the assertion fails?"
```
The AI will:
- Run tests in debug mode
- Break at test assertions
- Compare expected vs actual values
- Trace back to the source of discrepancy
- Suggest test or code fixes

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration Guide

### Using MCP Debug Tools with AI Assistants

For AI developers and users who want to leverage MCP Debug Tools in their AI-powered development workflows, we provide a comprehensive rules document that helps AI agents use these debugging tools effectively.

#### MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md

This document contains essential guidelines and patterns for AI agents to:
- Understand the proper sequence of debugging operations
- Handle common debugging scenarios efficiently
- Recover from errors gracefully
- Follow best practices for performance and safety

#### How to Use

1. **For AI Tool Users (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)**
   - Include the rules document in your AI assistant's context when debugging
   - Copy relevant sections from [`MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md`](./MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md) into your prompts
   - Example prompt:
     ```
     I need to debug my Node.js application. Please follow the MCP Debug Tools
     rules for proper tool sequencing and error handling.
     [Paste relevant sections from MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md]
     ```

2. **For Custom AI Agent Development**
   - Use the rules document as a reference for implementing debugging workflows
   - Incorporate the sequential operation patterns into your agent's logic
   - Follow the error recovery strategies for robust debugging automation

3. **Key Sections to Reference**
   - **Prerequisites Check**: Ensure environment is ready before debugging
   - **Tool Categories**: Understand the 5 main tool categories and their purposes
   - **Sequential Operations**: Follow the proper order of debugging operations
   - **Common Workflows**: Pre-built patterns for typical debugging scenarios
   - **Error Recovery**: Handle failures and recover gracefully

#### Benefits of Following the Rules

- ✅ **Reduced Errors**: Proper tool sequencing prevents common mistakes
- ✅ **Efficient Debugging**: Optimized workflows save time and resources
- ✅ **Better AI Assistance**: AI can provide more accurate debugging help
- ✅ **Consistent Results**: Standardized patterns ensure reliable outcomes

#### Example AI-Assisted Debugging Session

```
User: "Help me find why my function returns undefined"

AI (using rules):
1. First, I'll check available VSCode instances (list-vscode-instances)
2. Set a breakpoint at the function start (add-breakpoint)
3. Start debug session (start-debug)
4. When paused, inspect all variables (get-variables-scope)
5. Step through to find where undefined is introduced (step-over)
6. Suggest the fix based on findings
```

For the complete rules and patterns, see [`MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md`](./MCP_DEBUG_TOOLS_RULES.md)

## 📊 Current Limitations
- Real-time sync limited by MCP protocol constraints

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Remote debugging
- Performance profiling tools

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### CLI Can't Find VSCode
1. Verify VSCode Extension is active
2. Check `.mcp-debug-tools/config.json` exists
3. Try manual connection with `--port` option

### Multiple VSCode Windows
- CLI auto-selects based on current directory
- Use `list-vscode-instances` to check active instances
- Use `select-vscode-instance` to choose specific instance
